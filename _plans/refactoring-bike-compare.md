# BikeCompare Component Refactoring Plan

## Context

### Component Overview
- `BikeCompare` is a React component that allows users to compare geometry between two bikes
- Located at: `src/components/BikeCompare.tsx`
- Core functionality:
  - Bike selection from dropdown or manual entry
  - Stack/reach comparison calculations
  - URL state management for selections
  - Manual vs automatic calculation modes

### Current Pain Points
- Complex state management mixing URL and local state
- Component handles too many responsibilities
- Duplicate code in bike selection logic
- Manual/auto calculation modes create unnecessary complexity
- Props and event handlers could be more consistent

### Key Dependencies
- @tanstack/react-router for routing/URL state
- shadcn components for UI elements
- Tailwind for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

### Related Files
- `src/bikes.json` - Bike data source
- `src/utils/stackToSpacers.ts` - Core calculation utility
- `src/schemas.ts` - Contains URL parameter schema

## How to Use This Document

### During Implementation
1. Follow the Implementation Order section at the bottom of the document
2. For each phase:
   - Review the plan thoroughly before starting
   - Update the phase status to ‚è≥ when work begins
   - Fill out Implementation Notes as you go:
     - List all files changed
     - Document key decisions and their rationale
     - Note any challenges encountered
     - Describe solutions implemented
   - Update status to ‚úÖ when phase is complete
   - If blocked, update status to ‚ùå and document the blocker

### Status Updates
- Use the Status Legend at the bottom of the document
- Keep statuses current to track progress
- Update the Implementation Order section to show current focus

### Best Practices
- Document decisions as they're made, not after
- Include enough detail in Implementation Notes to understand changes later
- If a phase's plan needs updating, document the change and why
- Cross-reference related changes between phases

## Goals
- Reduce complexity and improve code organization
- Eliminate code duplication
- Improve component readability and maintainability
- Better separation of concerns

## Phase 1: State Management and Custom Hook
**Status**: üîÑ Not Started

### Plan
1. Create `useBikeSelection` hook
   - Move URL parameter management logic
   - Handle custom bike state
   - Consolidate bike selection handlers
   ```typescript
   interface UseBikeSelectionResult {
     leftBike: BikeDetails | null;
     rightBike: BikeDetails | null;
     handleBikeSelect: (bikeId: string, side: 'left' | 'right') => void;
     handleCustomBikeChange: (bike: BikeDetails | null, side: 'left' | 'right') => void;
     resetSelection: () => void;
   }
   ```

### Implementation Notes
- Files changed:
- Key decisions:
- Challenges encountered:
- Solutions implemented:

## Phase 2: Component Splitting
**Status**: üîÑ Not Started

### Plan
1. Split BikeSelector into focused components
   - Create `BikeCombobox` component
     - Handle only bike selection from dropdown
     - Simplify props interface
   - Create `ManualBikeForm` component
     - Handle only manual bike entry
     - Use object parameters pattern
   - Update BikeSelector to use new components

2. Create `ComparisonResults` component
   - Move calculation display logic
   - Simplify props interface
   - Handle both manual and auto calculations

### Implementation Notes
- Files changed:
- Key decisions:
- Challenges encountered:
- Solutions implemented:

## Phase 3: Type Organization
**Status**: üîÑ Not Started

### Plan
1. Create new types file
   - Move BikeDetails interface
   - Add proper documentation
   - Consolidate search param types
   ```typescript
   // types/bike.ts
   export interface BikeDetails {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     stack: number;
     reach: number;
     // ...
   }
   ```

### Implementation Notes
- Files changed:
- Key decisions:
- Challenges encountered:
- Solutions implemented:

## Phase 4: Calculation Logic
**Status**: üîÑ Not Started

### Plan
1. Move calculation logic to utils
   - Create `calculations.ts` utility file
   - Simplify calculation flow
   - Remove manual vs auto distinction
   - Add proper error handling

2. Update component to use new utilities
   - Simplify calculation triggering
   - Improve error states

### Implementation Notes
- Files changed:
- Key decisions:
- Challenges encountered:
- Solutions implemented:

## Phase 5: Props and Event Handler Consolidation
**Status**: üîÑ Not Started

### Plan
1. Implement object parameters pattern
   - Update component props to use objects
   - Add proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Add JSDoc documentation

2. Consolidate event handlers
   - Create unified handler for bike changes
   - Improve type safety
   - Add proper error handling

### Implementation Notes
- Files changed:
- Key decisions:
- Challenges encountered:
- Solutions implemented:

## Implementation Order
1. Phase 1 - Foundation for other changes ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Next up
2. Phase 3 - Types needed for other phases
3. Phase 2 - Component splitting
4. Phase 4 - Calculation logic
5. Phase 5 - Final cleanup and optimization

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality during refactor
  - **Mitigation**: Manual testing between phases
- **Risk**: Performance impact from component splitting
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor component rendering and state updates
- **Risk**: URL state management complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Careful state transition handling

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Reduced component complexity
- [ ] Eliminated code duplication
- [ ] Maintained existing functionality
- [ ] Better type safety
- [ ] Cleaner props interfaces

## Status Legend
- üîÑ Not Started
- ‚è≥ In Progress
- ‚úÖ Completed
- ‚ùå Blocked
